# ðŸ“˜ FFLIQ Reference Guide

*This document captures the vision, technical strategy, and development guidelines for the FFLIQ project. It serves as a comprehensive reference for project direction.*

## 1. Market & Competitive Analysis

**Core Observations**
- **Platform Giants:** ESPN/Yahoo offer hosting but generally lack deep, integrated analytical insights.
- **Sleeper:** Praised for great UX and social features, but analysis depth can be limited.
- **Specialized Tools:** FantasyPros/Rotowire offer projections and analysis but often require subscriptions and can have clunky UIs.
- **AI Usage:** Currently rare in mainstream platforms and usually shallow.
- **Positioning:** FFLIQ aims to be a *premium*, AI-powered application giving users a competitive edge through superior UX and actionable, personalized insights.

  - Actual player performance
  - Fields: id, nfl_player_id, week_number, season_year, normalized stat fields (passing_yards, passing_tds, interceptions, rushing_yards, rushing_tds, receptions, receiving_yards, receiving_tds, fumbles_lost, kicking stats, defensive stats, etc.), provider_id, raw_stats (JSON), last_updated

- **PlayerProjection**
  - Projected performance
  - Fields: Similar to PlayerStats plus projection_source, created_at

- **PlayerPoints**
  - Cached calculated fantasy points
  - Fields: id, nfl_player_id, league_id, week_number, season_year, points, calculated_at

- **PlayerNews**
  - Player news and updates for AI recommendations
